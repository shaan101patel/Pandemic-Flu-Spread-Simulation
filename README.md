# Pandemic-Flu-Spread-Simulation
The goal of this project is to simulate the spread of pandemic flu within a large, spatially explicit population using an agent-based approach. The model allows for investigation of infection dynamics, intervention strategies, and vaccination logistics, providing a rigorous platform for quantitative analysis and policy exploration.
